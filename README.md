# Egyptian-Hieroglyphs
Egyptian hieroglyphs are one of the oldest writing systems in the world, used by the ancient Egyptians for nearly 3,000 years. Comprising a combination of logographic and alphabetic elements, these symbols were carved into monuments, painted on papyrus, and inscribed on tomb walls. Hieroglyphs offer a window into the culture, religion, and daily life of ancient Egypt.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on the digitization, recognition, and analysis of Egyptian hieroglyphs using machine learning. We have separated images of hieroglyphs and trained, tested, and validated these images for pattern recognition.
